C.	Project Objectives:
 	To train the Decision Tree model to be able to predict if a player‚Äôs passing (in soccer) would be successful.
 	To gather enough insights in understanding the nature of the soccer players and how they determine if a passing would be successful or not.
 	To strengthen the Decision Tree predictive capability by improving the dataset.
 	To train another model and identify the best-performing model through comparison and optimization.
 	To understand why the best model makes certain predictions.
 	To communicate your model‚Äôs performance and findings effectively using data visualizations.
üìä Dataset
‚Ä¢	Source: FIFA 15 player data
‚Ä¢	Original File: raw_data.csv (15,465 players, 104 features)
‚Ä¢	Processed File: processed_data.csv (with engineered features)
‚Ä¢	Key Features: Player attributes, physical characteristics, and skill ratings
üîß Methodology
Data Preprocessing
1.	Target Variable Creation: Engineered pass_completed binary label based on passing score threshold (70)
2.	Feature Selection: Selected 7 key attributes:
o	dribbling, passing, overall, potential
o	age, height_cm, weight_kg
3.	Data Cleaning: Handled missing values using median imputation
4.	Train-Test Split: 80-20 split with stratification
Model Selection
‚Ä¢	Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier
‚Ä¢	Configuration: max_depth=4, random_state=42
‚Ä¢	Rationale: Chosen for interpretability and ability to handle non-linear relationships
üìà Key Results
Model Performance
‚Ä¢	Test Accuracy: 100% (suggests potential data leakage)
‚Ä¢	Class Distribution:
o	Pass Completed (1): 1,052 players (6.8%)
o	Not Completed (0): 14,413 players (93.2%)
Key Insights
1.	Skill Scarcity: Only 6.8% of players classified as high-quality passers
2.	Feature Importance: Passing ability strongly correlated with overall player quality and dribbling skills
3.	Interpretable Rules: Decision Tree provides clear, human-readable decision paths
üöÄ How to Run the Code
Prerequisites
bash
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
Required Packages
‚Ä¢	pandas>=1.5.3
‚Ä¢	numpy>=1.21.6
‚Ä¢	scikit-learn>=1.2.2

‚Ä¢	seaborn>=0.12.2
‚Ä¢	jupyter>=1.0.0
‚Ä¢	joblib>=1.2.0
Execution Steps
1.	Place data files in the project directory:
o	raw_data.csv (original FIFA data)
2.	Run the Jupyter notebook:
bash
jupyter notebook pass_prediction_decision_trees.ipynb
3.	Execute cells in order:
o	The notebook will automatically:
ÔÇß	Load and preprocess the data
ÔÇß	Create engineered features
ÔÇß	Train the Decision Tree model
ÔÇß	Generate visualizations
ÔÇß	Save processed data as processed_data.csv

üí° Model Interpretation
The Decision Tree provides transparent decision rules such as:
‚Ä¢	"IF overall rating > X AND passing > Y THEN classify as good passer"
‚Ä¢	Easy to understand for coaches and scouts
‚Ä¢	No "black box" predictions
‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Future Work
1.	Data Leakage Concern: Perfect accuracy suggests the target variable may be derived from input features
2.	Recommendation: Use actual match statistics (pass completion %) instead of FIFA ratings for real-world validation
3.	Potential Enhancements:
o	Try other models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
o	Include more sophisticated feature engineering
o	Use cross-validation for robust evaluation
üë• Applications
‚Ä¢	Talent Scouting: Identify promising passers
‚Ä¢	Team Selection: Data-driven player selection
‚Ä¢	Player Development: Understand key attributes for passing success
This project demonstrates a practical approach to sports analytics using interpretable machine learning models.
